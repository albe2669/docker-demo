# Introduction to Docker
This repo contains a selection of increasingly complex Dockerfiles to demonstrate the basics of Docker. The folders are numbered in order from easiest to hardest.

05 and 06 are not Dockerfiles, but rather docker-compose.yml files. They are included to demonstrate the basics of docker-compose.

04 is missing by design as it was a real world example that I did not want to share publicly.

A recording of the presentation exists, and will be distributed when requested.
